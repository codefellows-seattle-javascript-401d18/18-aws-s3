      ===

      ## Submission Instructions
        * fork this repository & create a new branch for your work
        * write all of your code in a directory named `lab-` + `<your name>` **e.g.** `lab-susan`
        * push to your repository
        * submit a pull request to this repository
        * submit a link to your PR in canvas
        * write a question and observation on canvas

      ## Learning Objectives  
      * students will be able to upload static assets to AWS S3
      * students will be able to retrieve a cdn url that contains the previously uploaded static asset
      * students will be able to work with secret and public access keys

      ## Requirements
      #### Configuration
      * `package.json`
      * `.eslintrc.json`
      * `.eslintignore`
      * `.gitignore`
      * `README.md`

      #### Description
      * create an AWS account
      * create an AWS Access Key and Secret
        * add the Access Key and Secret to your `.env` file
        * **DO NOT SHARE THESE KEYS, AND DO NOT COMMIT THEM**
      * create a new model that represents a file type that you want to store on AWS S3
        * ex: `.mp3`, `.mp4`, `.png`, etc
      * create a test that uploads one of these files to your route
      * use the `aws-sdk` to assist with uploading
      * use `multer` to parse the file upload request

      #### Server Endpoint
      * `POST` - `/api/new-resource`
        * _your new resource will have a reference to the primary resource that we already have functional_
        * _that resource will need to be passed via the `req.body`_
      * `GET` - `/api/new-resource/:_id`
      * `PUT` - `/api/new-resource/:_id`
      * `DELETE` - `/api/new-resource/:_id`

      ## Tests
      * create a test to ensure that your API returns a status code of 404 for routes that have not been registered
      * create a series of tests to ensure that your `/api/resource-name` endpoint responds as described for each condition below:
      * `GET` - test **200**, for a request made with a valid id
      * `GET` - test **401**, if no token was provided
      * `GET` - test **404**, for a valid request with an id that was not found
      * `PUT` - test **200**, for a post request with a valid body
      * `PUT` - test **401**, if no token was provided
      * `PUT` - test **400**, if the body was invalid
      * `PUT` - test **404**, for a valid request made with an id that was not found
      * `POST` - test **200**, for a post request with a valid body
      * `POST` - test **401**, if no token was provided
      * `POST` - test **400**, if no body was provided or if the body was invalid


      #### Bonus: 3pts
      * try using the `deleteObject` method provided by the `aws-sdk` to delete an object *(file)* from S3
        * you will need to pass in a `params` object that contains the associated Bucket and AWS object key in order to delete the object from s3
        * ex:
        ``` javascript
        var params = {
          Bucket: 's3-bucket-name',
          Key: 'object-filename'
        }
        s3.deleteObject(params)
        ```
      * don't forget to remove the resource from the DB

      ```
